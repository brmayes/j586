          The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter began in 2012 in conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement.
          The movement was started by protesters who objected the tragic death of teenager Trayvon Martin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The movement has since continued to grow and transform as more Black individuals across the
          United States were wrongfully killed.

          <h3>Trayvon Martin, 17</h3>
          <p><span class="caps">Location: </span>Sanford, Fl.</p>
          <p>
            On Feb. 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin was fatally shot by neighborhood watch captain,
            George Zimmerman. On Martin’s walk home from a 7-Eleven, Zimmerman reported to
            911 that Martin “looked suspicious” and followed him. Zimmerman was ordered not
            to leave his vehicle, which he later disregarded. Martin was wearing a dark hoodie
            and carrying a bottle of iced tea and a bag of Skittles that he purchased from
            7-Eleven in his hood pocket. Martin was unarmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Martin’s death caused a national outcry for the justice of violence against Black lives.
            The hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=blacklivesmatter&src=typd">#BlackLivesMatter</a>
            was born. Moreover, the Movement Black Lives Matter was started.

          <h3>Eric Garner, 43</h3>
          <p><span class="caps">Location: </span>Staten Island, NY</p>
          <p>
            On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner was put in a chokehold by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo on Bay Street
            in Staten Island, NY. Garner was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes, but was unarmed. Garner,
            who suffered from asthma, yelled his last words, “I can’t breathe,” trying to get officers to release
            his neck from the chokehold. A medical examiner ruled Garner’s death a homicide from a chokehold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pantaleo was not indicted despite the fact that chokeholds are ruled illegal in New York.
            The incident was also fully caught on camera by a bystander.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social media erupted with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=blacklivesmatter&src=typd">#ICantBreathe</a>
            to symbolize the struggle by Garner as well as the feeling of racial oppression.

          <h3>Michael Brown, 18</h3>
          <p><span class="caps">Location: </span>Ferguson, Mo.</p>
          <p>
            On Aug. 9, 2014, Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson. Brown, who was
            confirmed as unarmed, was fatally shot after confrontation with Wilson for walking in the street. Brown
            lied in the street for four hours before authorities came to the scene. On November 24, 2014, the grand
            jury decided not to indict Wilson, continuing the national outcry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brown’s death erupted protests nationwide, which have continued to this day. Social media
            users hashtagged <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=dontshoot&src=typd">#DontShoot</a>,

            support for Brown, his family and the struggle in Ferguson. Additionally, social media showed
            strong interest in news portrayal of victims.

          <h3>Tamir Rice, 12</h3>
          <p><span class="caps">Location: </span>Cleveland, Ohio</p>
          <p>
            On Nov. 22, 2014, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was playing in Cudell Recreation Center park when
            he was shot by Timothy Loehmann. Rice was reported to have a gun by a bystander who
            called the police, but the caller reported that the gun was “probably fake.” Rice has a airsoft
            toy gun in his waistband, which Loehmann did not check for prior to shooting. Loehmann shot
            Rice after leaving his moving patrol vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the shooting, Rice’s 14-year old sister ran to the scene but was restrained by police. The
            officers failed to apply first aid to Rice until roughly four minutes following the incident. Rice
            died the following day, Nov. 23, 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social media continued outcry for the safety of Black youth in America. The shooting of Rice
            came only two days before the decision of the grand jury to not indict Darren Wilson, the
            officer who fatally shot Michael Brown.

          <h3>Eric Courtney Harris, 44</h3>
          <p><span class="caps">Location: </span>Tulsa, Okla.</p>
          <p>
            On April 2, 2015 Eric Courtney Harris was shot by reserve deputy Robert Charles Bates.
            Bates, 73, claims he meant to use a taser on Harris, but pulled his gun mistakingly. According
            to the LA Times, Bates is a “wealthy insurance executive with close personal and political ties
            to the sheriff.” Many accused Bates of “paying to play cop,” due to the numerous contributions
            of money, cars and equipment to the Sheriff's Office.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently a tape of Harris’ arrest surfaced, exposing an officer on tape saying, “Fuck your
            breath” to Harris. The video and death of Harris is the most recent spark of the Black Lives
            Matter movement. The incident has started a social media conversation about who gets to be
            a cop and continued the conversation about if the purpose of the law is meant to protect
            everyone or a select few.

          <h3>Walter L. Scott, 50</h3>
          <p><span class="caps">Location: </span>North Charleston, SC</p>
          <p>
            On April 4, 2015, Walter L. Scott was pulled over for a broken tail light by officer Michael T.
            Slanger but the incident would end in a fatal shooting. After been pulled over, Scott fled the
            scene because he owed child support, a crime which can send people to jail. A bystander was
            recording on a cell phone when the incident was happening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slager claimed that he feared for his life because Scott took his stun gun in a struggle.
            However, the bystander’s video shows that Scott was running away and being fired at eight
            times. Scott was struck by bullets three times in the back, once in the upper buttocks and
            once in the ear. At least one bullet entered his heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also on video, Slager is shown picking up what appears to be his stun gun and dropping it
            near Scott’s motionless body. Social media is responding with a hashtag of his name:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=walterscott&src=typd">#WalterScott</a>
            with the video of his shooting to generate media presence about the incident.
